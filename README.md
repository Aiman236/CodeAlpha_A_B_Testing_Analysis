This task focuses on analyzing an A/B testing experiment to evaluate whether a new landing page results in a higher user conversion rate compared to the existing one. The dataset provided contains information about user visits, their assigned group (control or treatment), the type of landing page they saw, and whether or not they converted. The analysis is performed using Python in a Jupyter notebook and includes steps like data cleaning, checking for inconsistencies between group assignment and landing page, and conducting hypothesis testing using statistical methods. The goal is to determine if the difference in conversion rates between the old and new pages is statistically significant or not. Based on the findings, a conclusion is drawn to either adopt the new page or stick with the existing one.
